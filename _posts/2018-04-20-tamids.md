# Introduction
Chicago today is a city of about 2.7 million people filled with tourist locations, business skyscrapers, and nightlife hotspots. The combination of high density destinations and strong tourist industry create a huge market for taxis, and Chicago’s taxi drivers have historically had a higher salary than those in most other cities, with a median of about $36,000 a year, with a few hotspots being moneymakers for these drivers. In recent years, however, the rideshare industry has changed the landscape of the transit markets in Chicago.  

Two competing ridesharing companies, Uber and Lyft, have seen rapid growth in recent years across the United States. While it’s possible that a portion of their business comes from growth in the ridesharing/taxi market itself, the rise of these ridesharing companies (and other smaller companies) has resulted in the decline of the taxi industry in many areas. Chicago’s taxi industry
in particular has taken a hit, as Uber and Lyft grew in the city with no major restrictions being placed on the ridesharing companies until the summer of 2016. The data used in this competition contains four years of training data and a segment of 2017’s data, which allow us to both explore Chicago’s taxi industry as a whole and fit predictive models on variables of interest. We are interested in what changes individual taxi drivers in Chicago experience, and forecasting future changes to these taxi drivers is of huge interest to the city of Chicago, especially as they consider adding harsher legislation to counter ridesharing companies. Forecasting the median daily fares will give us an idea of both how much business a typical taxi driver will see in a day as well as how much they will earn. In doing so, we aim to predict the future prospects of a typical Chicago taxi driver.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
In order to efficiently perform exploratory data analysis, we used a subset containing 1% of the data for each of the provided training datasets so that our subset’s yearly proportions were the same as those of the full data’s. Hourly, daily, monthly and yearly trends were compared over repeated subsets to demonstrate that the trends in each subset were representative of the full data’s trends. It should be noted that the EDA plots and summary statistics examined in this section of the report are all run on the same 1% subset.  

To create the visualizations used in Section 1 of the appendix, we created our subsets from the data with Perl, then loaded those subsets into R. We then processed the data to match up column names and to bind the data for 2013-2016 together. We used basic R commands like summary, median, and plot(x,y) for general exploration, and used functions from the ggplot package to produce the tables shown in the appendix. Segments of our cleaned up code are given at the bottom of the appendix.  

While exploring the data, we discovered some large scale trends. The number of rows (trip counts) in each dataset was noticeably different, with a decline from 2014 to 2016. Fares, trip lengths, and trip distances declined as well, though less dramatically than counts. Tips and tolls do not follow yearly trends. Each subset contained some extreme outliers, with some distances or fares being extraordinarily high relative to the other. We found that taking the medians of these variables with outliers by day/week/month erased the effects of the outliers, and that it was not necessary for EDA to exclude these outliers.  

Before taking a deep dive into how individual taxi drivers have been affected by changes to the industry, it is important to study the underlying seasonal trends and year to year changes of the industry as a whole. To effectively do so, we looked at median trip duration and the total number of trips respectively by hour of day, day of week, and month of year. Median trip duration was chosen as it is highly related to trip fare, our primary variable of interest for analysis. Trip count was chosen to show both the seasonality of taxi demand and the changes in demand from 2013 to 2016.  

## Median Trip Duration
We will begin by studying median trip duration over the years.
